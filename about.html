<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Web developer.I am proficient in programming languages such as HTML,CSS and Javascript.
  I use these languages to build the structure, style, and interactivity of websites.
  As a Front-end developer I focus on the user interface and user experience of a website.
  I ensure that the website is visually appealing, responsive, and functions well 
   across different devices and browsers.
</p>

<p>
  Back-end developers work on the server side of web development.
 They manage databases, server configurations, and application logic to 
  ensure the proper functioning of websites.Previously i had no experience in back end.
  From the past six months i am learning back end programming language Python.
  Some developers work as full-stack developers, meaning they have skills in both front-end and back-end development.
  Full-stack developers can handle the entire web development process, from designing the user interface to
   managing server databases.
</p>

<p>
  Web developers often use frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js 
  for front-end development, and Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails for back-end development.
  Web developers implement responsive design techniques to ensure that websites work seamlessly 
  on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
  Developers are responsible for testing and debugging their code to identify and 
  fix errors or issues that may arise during the development process.

<p>
  Knowledge of version control systems, such as Git, is crucial for web developers to manage and track 
  changes to the codebase, collaborate with other developers, and roll back changes if needed.
  Web developers need to ensure that websites function consistently across different web browsers, 
  addressing compatibility issues that may arise.Developers implement security measures to protect websites 
  from common threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other vulnerabilities.
  The field of web development is dynamic, and developers need to stay updated with the latest 
  technologies and trends to remain effective in their roles.Web developers often collaborate with designers, 
  other developers, and stakeholders to bring a project to completion, requiring effective communication and teamwork.
